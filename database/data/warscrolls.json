    "description": "A unit of Dwarf Warriors has 10 or more models. Most Dwarf Warriors enter battle armed with either a Dwarf Axe or a Dwarf Hammer, but some units prefer instead to wield Double-handed Dwarf Axes to cut down their foes with mighty swings. Many units also carry sturdy Dwarf Shields.",
